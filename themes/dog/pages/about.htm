					I’m Abbi, but that’s irrelevant. Abbi Schmabbi, that’s what they like to call me. And by they, I guess I mean myself. Born in dreary Fargo and raised in the frozen tundra that is Minnesota, I now live in Vietnam with my COVID puppy, Ren. You may find her name and essence threaded through my personal work. At 31, I’ve bounced around jobs and careers so long that I’ve grown tired and ultimately settled back into one of my old lifelong dreams: to become a starving artist. Fortunately, I live in Vietnam so the starving part won’t be much of an issue here. While graphic design is not my passion nor my end goal, I consider it a decent stepping stone to something I’m more passionate about. Illustration and video game design.
